function [ptrace_out ptrace_out_filename]= ptracejoin (ptrace1, flp1, ptrace2, flp2, position)
%This function joins two ptrace files or structures for  the given
%position based on the floorplan and retuns the joined ptrace file

%The operation in similar to flpjoin.m 

%ptrace1 = power trace file or strcuture 1
% flp1 = floorplan of trace 1
%ptrace2 = power trace file or strcuture 2
% flp2 = floorplan of trace 2
%ptrace_out = power trace file or strcuture output

%ptrace_out_filename = filename of the output file
